    "@tbl-consumption shows the estimated energy consumption (% and mA) for each configuration and device (i.e., `C1` and `C2`). The average consumption per TUG execution using the system with the `C1` configuration is approximately $0.01\\%$ and $0.005\\%$ of the total battery of the smartwatch and the smartphone respectively, which is around $0.058mA$ and $0.254mA$, yielding a combined consumption of $0.312mA$. In `C2` configuration, the system consumes $0.006\\%$ of the smartphone's battery, which equals $0.307mA$. While both configurations report a similar consumption, `C1` is limited by the consumption of the smartwatch device with respect to `C2` (i.e., the smartwatch's battery would run out before the smartphone's)."
