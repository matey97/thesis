# Introduction

The research on this dissertation is centred on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) topic, whose main objective is to characterize the activities performed by human subjects automatically. This research field has had a large trajectory, which will continue due to its breadth of possibilities and room for improvement: sensing technologies, sensing devices, types of activities, applications, etc. 

Throughout this thesis, we explore two sensing technologies, several devices and activities following certain research objectives. These research objectives are based on the two fundamental pillars captured in the dissertation's title: the usage of consumer devices and the applicability of HAR to real-life scenarios. 

On the one hand, instead of complex sensor networks of devices scattered around the body or specific and expensive devices, common consumer devices such as smartphones and smartwatches -- owned by more than $7$ billion and $200$ million users worldwide, respectively -- or cheap devices -- around $15$â‚¬ -- will be employed. On the other hand, the feasibility of applying the research to real-life settings is a paramount aspect: research must translate into benefits for the population, otherwise, research loses its reason. Therefore, the analyses and experiments contained in this dissertation will be designed to evaluate the feasibility of consumer-based HAR systems in real-life conditions.

## Motivation
HAR is a research area aiming to determine human behaviour, actions, and activities from physical signals extracted from sensing devices. Historically, HAR has had two main approaches regarding sensing devices: vision- and inertial-based sensors. More recently, a breakthrough approach was proposed: monitoring the state of the channels of Wi-Fi networks (i.e., Wi-Fi CSI), which can be affected by the presence and movement of individuals, among other factors. In this thesis, we focus on inertial- and Wi-Fi CSI-based HAR.

### Inertial-based HAR
The mainstream availability of smartphones and smartwatches equipped with IMUs offers an inexpensive, ubiquitous, and reliable way to develop HAR systems that can be employed in real-life scenarios. Due to the potential of these systems, some challenges and opportunities were identified:

- Modern Android smartphones and  Wear OS smartwatches suffer from energy restrictions that can affect the data collection. The guidelines proposed by @gonzalez2022using overcome these restrictions, showing only a $1\%$ of missing data in their experiments. Therefore, providing data collection libraries implementing these guidelines might be useful for the HAR and other communities.
- Only five public datasets with smartphone and smartwatch data for HAR exist, where four of them used the devices in their common placement (carried in a pocket and the wrist, respectively). From those, RealWorld [@sztyler2016],  ExtraSensory [@vaizman2017] and DOMINO [@arrotta2023domino] include data from diverse people in terms of age and gender, traits that might help build generalizable HAR systems. Therefore, the HAR research community would benefit from more public datasets addressing these issues.
- There are no works exploring how the accuracy of ML and DL evolves regarding the amount of training data in smartphone- and smartwatch-based HAR. In addition, existing research presents contradictory results in terms of data sources and model comparisons. It might be helpful to have a study exploring how ML and DL models evolve regarding the quantity of data used for their training while also comparing with data source and model architecture performs better.
- Most of the existing real-life smartphone- and smartwatch-HAR-based systems focus on mHealth applications. However, the clinical reliability of those systems is not usually evaluated. Therefore, developing a mHealth system to solve a real-life problem with its corresponding clinical evaluation would be a great research output.


### Wi-FI CSI-based HAR
Regarding the new trend in Wi-Fi CSI-based HAR, we observed that few works employed ESP32 microcontrollers and that one of them pointed out a possible instability over time in the collected CSI data that could undermine the performance of HAR systems. Therefore, more research on this topic would be useful to shed light on the mentioned issue and determine its viability in real-life scenarios.

## Research objectives
From the identified challenges and opportunities, the following research objectives were defined and will be addressed in successive chapters:

- **RO1: Provide tools for reliable data collection in Android smartphones and Wear OS smartwatches.** Develop open-source libraries enabling the development of smartphone and smartwatch applications for data collection.
- **RO2: Collect HAR dataset of smartphone and smartwatch data from heterogeneous subjects.** Generate a public dataset composed of IMU data from a smartphone and smartwatch carefully selecting participants to preserve age diversity and gender balance. 
- **RO3: Analyse and compare the effect of the amount of training data, the data source and the model architecture on the performance of ML- and DL-based HAR.** Determine how the accuracy of several model architectures evolves regarding the amount of data used for training them and the nature of the data employed. Provide hints that might guide researchers when choosing the amount of data they need to collect, the most suitable data source or the most appropriate model for their HAR systems.
- **RO4: Development and evaluation of an mHealth system using HAR with smartphones and smartwatches.** Develop a smartphone and smartwatch application capable of automating the computation of results of a well-known mobility test and evaluating its clinical reliability.
- **RO5: Analyse the feasibility of Wi-Fi CSI data for real-life HAR systems.** Design experiments to evaluate the use of CSI data collected with ESP32 microcontrollers taking into account the stability of the data over time.

These research objectives constitute the path of the thesis (@fig-thesis_path), which focuses on inertial-based HAR with the development of data collection tools, the collection of a dataset, a study of the factors affecting the performance of ML and DL models, and the development and evaluation of an mHealth application focusing on inertial-based HAR, to finish with a feasibility study of the usage of the Wi-Fi CSI data for HAR.
